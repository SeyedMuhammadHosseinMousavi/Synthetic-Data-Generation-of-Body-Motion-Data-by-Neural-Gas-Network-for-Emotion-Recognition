# Synthetic-Data-Generation-of-Body-Motion-Data-by-Neural-Gas-Network-for-Emotion-Recognition

## Abstract
This research addresses the challenges in emotion recognition using body motion data, primarily the scarcity of diverse and generalizable datasets. Employing Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) methods like GANs and VAEs shows promise but comes with complexity. We introduce a novel application of the Neural Gas Network (NGN) algorithm for synthesizing body motion data, optimizing diversity and generation speed. By learning skeletal structure topology, NGN fits neurons or gas particles on body joints to synthesize new body postures over frames, enhancing dataset quality for emotion recognition.

## Neural Gas Network - Method Overview
The Neural Gas Network (NGN) is a machine learning algorithm that learns topologies in an unsupervised manner, similar to Self-Organizing Maps. It excels in clustering and visualizing high-dimensional data, fitting the neurons or gas particles on body joints, and synthesizing new body postures by attaching these postures over frames.

## Contributions
Our approach synthesizes diverse and realistic body motion datasets using a supervised version of NGN. It effectively maps the complex topology of human skeletal structure, generating body motions that maintain inherent emotional expressions with added novel variations, achieving higher synthesizing speed compared to existing methods.

## Evaluation and Results
We compared our generated dataset against others using benchmark metrics like Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID), Diversity, and other classification metrics. The findings demonstrate that NGN produces more realistic and emotionally distinct body motion data and does so with greater speed.
